Cratermatic is the result of Michael Mendenhall's summer 2006 internship at the Lunar and Planetary Institute in Houston, TX.
The goal of the internship research was to develop methods for automated characterization of craters from topography data
(specifically, altimetry data from the MOLA instrument on the Mars Global Surveyor orbiter).
Cratermatic is a set of C++ routines for manipulating topography datasets, accessible through either the command line or an interactive "image calculator" interface.

This project was originally hosted at SourceForge: http://cratermatic.sourceforge.net/
The move to Github was made January 2015, to permit easier future collaboration using the code.
